# Javascript Notes


### Ecmascript
- It is a standard on which javascript is based.
- Javascript & ECMA script can almost always be used interchangably, Javascript is very liberal in what it allows.

### Ways of executing Javascript 

- Javascript can be executed in browser, in `Inspect` -> `console`.
- Another way is to use a runtime like `node.js` which we can install and use.
- Adding `<script>` tag in html document, and writing javascript code inside it.
