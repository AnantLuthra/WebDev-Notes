# Web Development 

- This repository contains my notes/practice source code of whatever I learn throughout my web dev learning.
- I'm mainly studying from CS50x course of week 8 which is HTML, CSS, JS - [🔗](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/8/), also from codewithharry's webdevelopment youtube playlist - [🔗](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg)
- I'm making notes of both from both of the sources while learning. 
- My practice code file is also present in the repo.
- Also learning css through this video [🔗](https://youtu.be/Edsxf_NBFrw)
- Currently i'm using [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahR1blWXxgSlL4y9iQBnLpR) playlist for learning JS.
